Hello! I'm Yizhou Shan, I've recently graduated from [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/).

I'm joining [Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/) as a Research Scientist
to continue my research on making [Resource Disaggregation](https://github.com/lastweek/2022-UCSD-Thesis/blob/main/Yizhou_Shan_Dissertation_2022.pdf)
practical and deployable in public clouds.

Contact: **ys** AT **ucsd** DOT **edu**

You can find my [CV here](http://lastweek.io/pubs/Yizhou_Shan_CV.pdf).
