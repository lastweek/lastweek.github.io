Hello! I'm Yizhou Shan, a Ph.D. candidate at [University of California San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/),
advised by Prof. [Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/).
I am a member of [UCSD Wuklab](http://wuklab.io) and [UCSD SysNet](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/).
I was a [Purdue Boilermaker](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) during 2016-2019.

Contact: **ys** AT **ucsd** DOT **edu**
