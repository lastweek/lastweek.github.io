I'm learning Machine Learning, from the very beginning.
As always, I will document and share my learning process.
Let me know if you have reading recommendations, always welcomed!

I mostly focus on the system aspects, in particular, how to design efficient large-scale machine learning frameworks.
I care about operating system, network, storage, new hardware, and any other system related stuff.
ML workload has its unique traits.
