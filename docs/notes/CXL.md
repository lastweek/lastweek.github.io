## Intro

:sailboat:

You probably have heared about CXL a million times.
And you are probably wondering, what is it, eactly?
And why folks are so excited about it?
This note explains CXL from my own pespective.
In particular, what is it, how to use it, 
what's the current status, and what's next.

I'm no expert in the CXL protocol itself.
I'm just a systems researcher
who may need to compare my systems against CXL-enabled ones.
Hence my thoughts and views could be biased and wrong.
If you are looking for serious CXL specification stuff,
please check out the [official CXL site](https://www.computeexpresslink.org/).
