# About CXL

Planned. 06/19/2022


My general feeling is that people think very highly of CXL.
But I have unpopular opinions: I don't think CXL the technology itself
brings dramtic changes to the existing landscaple - some report
extremely low latency implementations (e.g., MSR CXL), but these
are limited in its scope. And to me, its merely moving some software VM
functionalaties into the CXL PCIe device.
Maybe I have some misunderstandings.

Nonetheless, that's WHY I want to write something about it.
This pushes me to read, think, and write clearly. Stay tuned.
