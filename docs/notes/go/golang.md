:sailboat:

I decided to learn Go and use it build some sample projects.
I may just start from a simple webserver.
Since Go is used a lot in virtualization part (e.g., Docker, gVisor)
and databases (mangoDB?), I'm thinking of doing along that line as well.

The learning code will be pushed into https://github.com/lastweek/learn-go.
