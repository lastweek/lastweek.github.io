This is my note on datacenter networking. This is work-in-progress.
I will try to cover the following topics:

- Peering
- Cloud gateways
- Cloud internal routing
- Networking Topology
- Software Defined Networking (SDN) and OpenFlow
- Networking Load Balancers
- Networking Upgrade
- Switch Hardware and Software (e.g., p4 switch)
- Host-side NIC Design
- Host-side Network Virtualization (e.g., OpenVSwitch and VPC)
- Transport Design (Retransmission and Congestion Control)
- RDMA and RoCE
- Host-side Networking Stack Design
