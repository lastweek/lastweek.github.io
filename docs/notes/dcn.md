For the past 1.5 years, I've been doing a networking related project
and was fortunate enough to read quite some datacenter networking (DCN) related work (thanks to those big companies).
I had a rough top-down DCN walk though in a google doc, touches both industry practice and academic ideas (e.g., pSwitch/pNIC etc). My plan is to polish that and link to it.

Well, I'm still quite busy for the following month. So the plan is to finish this roughly at the end of Sep 2021.
