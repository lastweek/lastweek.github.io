# Stock

I'm new to the market.
So anyone reading this should take the notes with a grain of salt.
I just want to document a few useful things to understand the stocks.
I'm truly amazed and grateful for so many great CREATORS out there
sharing their knowledges and deep insights.

I start seriously review data behind stocks because I don't want to take bets and make pure guess.
But being able to reason the data does not give me the power to predict market,
it only makes me feel more confident to make choices - right or wrong, both are fine.

## Indicators

!!! important inline end
    Trade what you see, not what you think.
    Avoid confirmation bias.

TODO:
1. Catagorize by purposes.
2. also think about when to which ones.
3. what each indicator can tell you.

- Moving Average (MA)
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- RSI
- MACD
- Stoch
- Bias
- ATR

### Unusual Whales

Read more tactics here: https://unusualwhales.com/spears.

1. Look for high VOL/OI ratio (maybe larger than 5?)
2. The bid/ask spread should be small. Smaller the better. It also means more volumn.
3. Pay attention to IV. Many people suggest IV < 100%
4. Pay attention to the strike price and date. I haven't fully grasp the core idea. Yet to learn.
5. Mon/Fri close/mornings options somehow have  higher average max return.

## Tools

I'm mostly using TradingView, half an hour is enough to learn the basics.
I highly recommend it if you also know a bit programming. It allows you
to express things in Python.

I sometimes check https://unusualwhales.com/ for unusual options,
which maybe potential insider tradings.

I also use https://finviz.com/.

Last but not least, Reddit, of course :)

I think researching about stock is a VERY TIME CONSUMING task.
It is very easy to lose the balance between your real life and this.
I'm still learning to control this.

The reason we got into stock is probabaly making money.
But during my short period of time in this,
I find myself more educated on different industries, on earnings,
on how to evaluate companies, on how to think about the future of a company,
on innovations, things like that.
In other words, it does help you learn unexpected things and keep up with the technology innovation.

It also make you more emotionally strong, more resilient to failures and to up and downs.

## Behavior Economics
This topic is really interesting.
I may able to document more later.
